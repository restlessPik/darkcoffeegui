# Dark Coffee GUI
This resourcepack aims to improve Minecraft's User Interface with a more warm and dark palette, taking its more simple design and transforming it into something fancier and more visually appealing, perfect for those late night sessions.

This page is mainly for issues
## Compatibility
Made for versions 1.8 through 1.20. In the future I will focus only on newer versions, I will only update older versions if its something critical.

Works without the need of any mod.

From version 1.16 and below, the colored text will be white and only work in English US. There are no plans to implement more language support at the moment, but if I have time I will try to look into it.

## Coming in the near future

- Mod support
